Open Engineering (not reinventing the wheel)
===

Why Libre Office?
===

Libre Office is open source and free.

Its file format is XML, human readable and Git capable, making light-weight version control and merging of improvements by other green people of this world possible.

It features easy and structured calculation possibilities. (Cells can be coloured.)

Cells can be analysed in graphs directly in Liberty Office.

It allows for programming directly on the data using (Visual) Basic language.

This makes it possible to integrate numerical or analytical algorithms that are essential in many parts of engineering.
 


Goals
===

A greener and healthy planet (for both animals, fungi and plants). The ecological impact will always be eyed with.

Biology, technology and Geology are important factors of this undertaking.

We want a green, life-quarrel minimizing project, for a better world.

Organisation-like structures will be rejected. Development is not only open, it also has no hierarchies. Good arguments and dialogue will prevail.


Concerns due to misuse?
===

Everything can be misused. Even closed-source information can be hacked by terrorists if they really wanted to (and perhaps they want, and then the effect'd be only negative - and noone even'd know they had the technology).

Furthermore as the main purpose of this engineering is ecological appliances, the danger of misuse is reduced as no easy instructions or preset calculations exist for e.g. building dangerous things.

Instead, to know how to create own power and have proper design (calculations) and instructions available as Open source, may even prevent terrorists from doing harmful things to acquire access to other power sources. They'll get their power sources (by force) if they want anyway.

Thus it may even be less harm done if they can construct their own power plants instead of getting their power by force.

=> Therefore an open engineering resource like this may do more good than it can be misused. Of course misuse is possible, but cornerstones will be surrected and without much knowledge circumventing the effects of these cornerstones will be difficult.
